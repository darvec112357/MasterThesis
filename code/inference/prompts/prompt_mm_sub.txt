Input:
Patricia is making a highlight film about her basketball team. She recorded video of every player and plans to put it all together in a longer movie. She has 130 seconds of the point guard, 145 seconds of the shooting guard, 85 seconds of the small forward, x seconds of the power forward, and 180 seconds of the center. How on average, how many minutes does each player get?

Response:
Sub-question 1: What is the total duration of the video in seconds?
Answer to Sub-question 1: 130 + 145 + 85 + x + 180 = 540 + x
Sub-question 2: What is the average duration of the video in seconds?
Answer to Sub-question 2: (130 + 145 + 85 + x + 180) / 5 = (540 + x) / 5
Sub-question 3: How many seconds is 2 minutes equal to?
Answer to Sub-question 3: 2 * 60 = 120
Sub-question 4: Can you form an equation with x?
