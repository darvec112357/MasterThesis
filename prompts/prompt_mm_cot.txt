Input:
Dave breaks 2 guitar strings per night when playing live.  If he performs 6 shows a week for 12 weeks, how many guitar strings will he need to replace?

Response:
Dave breaks 2 guitar strings per night, so he breaks 2 * 6 = 12 strings per week.
He performs 6 shows a week for 12 weeks, so he will perform a total of 6 * 12 = 72 shows.
If he breaks 12 strings per week, then he will need to replace 12 * 12 = 144 guitar strings over the 12 weeks.
Final Answer: 144<eos>

Input:
If there are initially 5 bananas on the fruit display and the number of oranges is twice the number of bananas, and the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, what is the total number of fruits on the display?

Response:
The number of oranges is twice the number of bananas, so there are 5 x 2 = 10 oranges.
The number of apples is twice the number of oranges, so there are 10 x 2 = 20 apples.
In total, there are 5 + 10 + 20 = 35 fruits on the display.
Final Answer: 35<eos>

Input:
If a community is constructing a metal fence consisting of 10 fence panels, where each panel is composed of 3 metal sheets and 2 metal beams, and each sheet requires 10 metal rods while each beam requires 4 metal rods, how many metal rods does the community need in total for the entire fence?

Response:
Each fence panel requires 3 metal sheets and 2 metal beams.
So for 10 fence panels, the community will need 10 * 3 = 30 metal sheets.
And for 10 fence panels, the community will need 10 * 2 = 20 metal beams.
Each metal sheet requires 10 metal rods, so the community will need 30 * 10 = 300 metal rods for the sheets.
Each metal beam requires 4 metal rods, so the community will need 20 * 4 = 80 metal rods for the beams.
In total, the community will need 300 + 80 = 380 metal rods for the entire fence.
Final Answer: 380<eos>

Input:
Three years ago, Rosie purchased an art piece for $4000. The same art piece will be x times as much in another three years. How much money will the art piece have increased by?
If we know the answer to the above question is 8000, what is the value of unknown variable x?

Response:
Three years ago, Rosie purchased the art piece for $4000.
In another three years, the art piece will be x times as much as it is now.
So the increased amount of money is: (x * $4000) - $4000.
We are given that the increased amount is $8000, so we can write: (x * $4000) - $4000 = $8000.
Simplifying the left side, we get: $4000x - $4000 = $8000.
Adding $4000 to both sides, we get: $4000x = $12000.
Dividing both sides by $4000, we get: x = 3.
The value of x is 3.
Final Answer: 3<eos>

Input:
Patricia is making a highlight film about her basketball team. She recorded video of every player and plans to put it all together in a longer movie. She has 130 seconds of the point guard, 145 seconds of the shooting guard, 85 seconds of the small forward, x seconds of the power forward, and 180 seconds of the center. How on average, how many minutes does each player get?
If we know the answer to the above question is 2, what is the value of unknown variable x?

Response:
The total time of the point guard's video is 130 seconds.
The total time of the shooting guard's video is 145 seconds.
The total time of the small forward's video is 85 seconds.
The total time of the power forward's video is x seconds.
The total time of the center's video is 180 seconds.
The average time each player gets is the total time divided by the number of players, which is 5 in this case.
So, the average time is (130 + 145 + 85 + x + 180) / 5 = (540 + x) / 5.
We are given that the average time is 2 minutes, which is equal to 2 * 60 = 120 seconds.
So we can write: (540 + x) / 5 = 120.
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get: 540 + x = 600.
Subtracting 540 from both sides, we get: x = 60.
The value of x is 60.
Final Answer: 60<eos>

Input:
Linda is building a new hotel with two wings. The first wing has 9 floors and each floor has 6 halls each with 32 rooms. The second wing has 7 floors each with x halls with 40 rooms each. How many rooms are in the hotel total?
If we know the answer to the above question is 4248, what is the value of unknown variable x?

Response:
The first wing has 9 floors and each floor has 6 halls with 32 rooms, so the total number of rooms in the first wing is 9 * 6 * 32 = 1728 rooms.
The second wing has 7 floors each with x halls with 40 rooms each, so the total number of rooms in the second wing is 7 * x * 40 = 280x rooms.
The total number of rooms in the hotel is the sum of the number of rooms in the first wing and the number of rooms in the second wing: 1728 + 280x.
We are given that the total number of rooms in the hotel is 4248, so we can write: 1728 + 280x = 4248.
Solving for x, we get: 280x = 2520.
Dividing both sides by 280, we get: x = 9.
The value of x is 9.
Final Answer: 9<eos>
